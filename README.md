# MyFirstNakamas

## Summary
This project is my first attempt to hook up dynamic persistent scene switches through nakama's room based multiplayer networking.




## Setup Notes:
Due to unity store licenses and purchased assets, I've git ignored the assets here and provided a link to their purchase in Asset/HappyMaki/Credits/
